# This is a test repository

The only goal of this repository is:

* To function as an assignment fo week 4 of the Data Science Toolbox Course
* To get a better grip on the relation betwen a local repo and a remote repo on GitHub

With regards to the latter, this specific line is created, just to see if I can pull this readme file to my local repo.
