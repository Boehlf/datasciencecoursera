# This is a test repository

The only goal of this repository is:

* To function as an assignment fo week 4 of the Data Science Toolbox Course
* To get a better grip on the relation betwen a local repo and a remote repo on GitHub

With regards to the latter, this specific line is created, just to see if I can pull this readme file to my local repo.

And I also wanted to play around a bit :smirk:

Simply to see whether I
1. understand that markdown a bit
1. or not

**I must say that his appears like a clumsy way to create a table
*But maybe one needs to grw into it
~~And then, I wouldn't know another
